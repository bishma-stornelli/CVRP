There are currently 24 data files.

The first set of data files are the 10 test problems from
Chapter 9 of S.Eilon, C.D.T.Watson-Gandy and N.Christofides
"Distribution management: mathematical modelling and
practical analysis" Griffin, London 1971.

Test problems 1, 2, ..., 10 from Chapter 9 are available
in files vrp1, vrp2, ..., vrp10 respectively.

The format of these data files is apparent from the tables
of data given in the above reference.

The second set of data files are the 14 test problems from
Chapter 11 of N.Christofides, A.Mingozzi, P.Toth and C.Sandi
(eds) "Combinatorial optimization", John Wiley, Chichester 1979.

Test problems 1, 2, ..., 14 from Chapter 11 are available
in files vrpnc1, vrpnc2, ..., vrpnc14 respectively.

The format of these data files is:
number of customers, vehicle capacity, maximum route time, drop time
depot x-coordinate, depot y-coordinate
for each customer in turn: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, quantity

Both sets of files are of size 15Kb (approximately).
